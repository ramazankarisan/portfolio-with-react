# Portfolio Project with React and Semantic-UI

* In this project, I have tried to use mainly Semantic-UI and after Bootstrap tried to use another framework and I can say my ***personal*** views at the bottom of my writing about using Semantic UI. 

## What I did with this project
* Mainly It is a portfolio page of mine. I did it for my module project at DCI and I don't think so, I will use it also in my personal working life, because my time was limited while I was doing it and my main aim was to practice React and Semantic UI.
* I used **ContextAPI** and **useReducer** just to handle the states.
* I used **React-Router-Dom** to manage the navigation between my pages.
* For Styling, I used **SCSS**.
* the best parts for me were *DarkMode toggling* and *language selection* features.

## what is missing
* I am aware of its responsivity for some small mobile screens not compatible.
* The Backend part is also missing(contact form has no functionality)
* Most texts are dummy text except for the projects.

## what could be better
* I am aware that it could be made also not using with React. React has made me do it in a short of time. Some animations, some useful packages could be used.
* The Responsivity could be better with using some `@media screen` codes, but I did not have time to engage myself during these times in. 

> My personal view about Semantic UI: I think, that anyone can get used to theirs components after a while hanging around  at theirs website, but I find its website content not so up-to-date. For me, I am mainly familiar with Functional Components and it is so rare to see an example which is explained with them in their websites. So I have experienced some difficulties while I was trying to use props and states (sometimes even for  getting a value of an input!). And its responsivity also not so customizable. And there was a mistake while I was just installing their's package and trying to use with my editor that I faced and for 2 days drove me crazy.  When anyone tried to install theirs package it has an extra semicolon inside its CSS file and Webpack could not compile because of it, but how really hardworking they are it is fixed in their GitHub. It took my 2 days and many unsuccessful deployment tries. To sum up, I don't think that I am not going to use it once more.
